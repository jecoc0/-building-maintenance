# Facilities Management App

## Description
This is a facilities management app that allows users to track facility projects and issues within those projects. Facilities Management/Maintenance can be difficutl to track because there are multiple projects with issues to be resolved. These issues can be discovered and submitted by many people.  Our goal was to consolidate the entering and tracking of these issues into one simple application.

First the user signs up to create their own profile within the application.  Then they can navigate to Overview to see all existing projects and their issues, or navigate to the Projects tab to create a new project using the modal that pops up.  Finally, the user can contact the team with any questions about the facilities and maintenance requests by sending a message through the contact page.

The website is styled with react-boostrap along with some custom CSS, especially used to integrate with the colors used by our customer.
